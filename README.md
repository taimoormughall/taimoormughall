# 👋 Hi, I'm Taimoor — AI Integration Engineer | Applied Machine Learning | Systems Automation

I work at the intersection of **AI engineering, backend integration, and IT systems**.  
My background blends 5 years of IT, DevOps, Automation with high end Integration logics, and 5 more years of data analytics, and AI engineering , moreover my post graduation in AI and ML from UT Austin has given me a practical, product-focused approach to building and integrating intelligent systems.

My work revolves around **making AI usable inside real products**, not just running experiments.

## 🔍 What I Do

### **AI & ML Integration**
- LLM integration (OpenAI APIs, proprietary conversational engines with offline models for data security)  
- Building conversational flows, automation agents.  
- OCR pipelines using Tesseract/PaddleOCR and more such OCR techniques.
- NER for structured data extraction.  
- Computer vision projects (YOLO + ByteTrack)  
- ML model deployment for various products and use cases. 

### **Backend & Automation**
- Python scripting for core data science leading to AI model development as well as automation.  
- FastAPI / Flask microservices for AI modules  
- REST API integration, webhooks.  
- Bash scripting for system tasks.
- Moderate DevOps handson (Docker, basic AWS GCP and AZURE usage with AI on Cloud use cases backed by certifications)  

### **Data Work**
- Power BI & Tableau dashboards. 
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction.  
- Predictive analysis for business problems. 
- Collaborating with data engineering teams.
